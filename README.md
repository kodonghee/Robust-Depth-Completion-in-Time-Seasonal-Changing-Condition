# Robust-Depth-Completion-in-Time-Seasonal-Changing-Condition
  * The Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) used for Style Transfer has been applied to the existing depth completion model so that depth information can be strongly estimated in a rain-night environment. 
  * As a result, we found that the accuracy of depth completion increased from about 77% to 80%. 

# Motivation
* Studies currently underway have set clear indoor or day outdoor images as datasets and conducted experiments.
* It is difficult to estimate depth information of image in Rain-Night environment.
