# Robust-Depth-Completion-in-Time-Seasonal-Changing-Condition
  The Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) used for Style Transfer has been applied to the existing depth completion model so that depth information can be strongly estimated in a rain-night environment. 
  As a result, we found that the accuracy of depth completion increased from about 77% to 80%. 

# Motivation
Considering that the subject data were taken during the day and that the depth completion study would be applied in areas such as autonomous driving in the future, we thought that the depth information should be robustly estimated in other weather environments.
